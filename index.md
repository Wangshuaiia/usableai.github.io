## About us 🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏾

+ <u>E</u>xplainability: The system can clearly explain its internal mechanisms to the user whenever an outcome is generated.
+ <u>A</u>ccessibility: The system is usable for people with a wide range of abilities and disabilities.
+ <u>S</u>calability: The system can adapt to varying levels of demand without compromising user experience.
+ <u>T</u>establility: The system is designed in such a way that its components and functionalities can be clearly specified and effectively tested.
