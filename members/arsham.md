### About me

As a PhD student at AIXLab, Chalmers University of Technology, I'm driven by my passion for artificial intelligence and entrepreneurship, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. My research is focused on emerging fields such as meta-learning, reinforcement learning, and computer vision. Along with a Master's degree in computer science from the University of Tehran, I am proficient in programming with Python and have expertise in developing AI algorithms using PyTorch. My ultimate goal is to apply advanced AI techniques to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions. I'm also interested in tech startups and how they can leverage AI to transform industries.
