### About me

I am a data scientist and graduate of the M.Sc. in **Applied Data Science** from the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology, with a background in **Economics** and **Industrial Engineering**.

I have a passion for all things Machine Learning & AI, but am especially interested in **generative models**, **computer vision**, **autonomous driving**, and **reinforcement learning**.

My main goal is to find exciting new ways to research, develop, and apply AI to improve our quality of life as a whole. My latest work has been researching ways in which generative models can help improve patient care in medicine, particularly in the field of echocardiogram analysis.

If there’s a complex project with potential for positive impact, then count me I’m in!
