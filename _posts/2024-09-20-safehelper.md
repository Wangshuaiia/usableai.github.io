### Description

The objective of this project is to create SafeHelper, a framework for designing and building LLM-based systems tailored for human-centric, safety-critical applications. SafeHelper aims to offer a structured approach to both the design and evaluation of these systems. Specifically, the SafeHelper framework includes three integral LLM components: SafeHelper.Interpreter, SafeHelper.Analyst, and SafeHelper.Guard, each dedicated to a unique function within the system to ensure reliable analysis, interpretation, and risk assessment.
