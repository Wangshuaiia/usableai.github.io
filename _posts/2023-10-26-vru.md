This project is focused on improving the safety and understanding of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) with reduced mobility across various traffic environments. Our research will provide a thorough understanding of their motion patterns and the safety challenges they face in different settings - both in terms of external threats and perceived danger. The ultimate objective of the project is to build an AI-enabled inclusive and infrastructure-aware traffic monitoring and analysis system.

In this interdesciplinary research, behavioral experts play a crucial role in interpreting these patterns and offering insights into user preferences, behaviors, and potential areas of risk. Their expertise will aid in pinpointing aspects of infrastructure that can be further optimized for enhanced accessibility and safety. Further, the insights derived from the data collected in this project will guide practical recommendations for infrastructure improvements and tailored safety measures.

Additionally, the data gathered will inform practical recommendations for infrastructure enhancements and specific safety measures. A vital part of this project also involves educating and raising community awareness about the daily experiences of these VRUs.
