### Description

In this project, we plan to combine AI-driven telemonitoring with specialized home care to improve management of heart failure (HF) patients. Using AI, we aim to develop a predictive model identifying advanced HF patients at high mortality risk within a year. Additionally, we plan an intuitive interface, utilizing large language models to communicate predictive outcomes to healthcaregivers. Our goal is to provide cost-efficient, safe, and effective home care for advanced HF patients, tailored to individual patient needs.
