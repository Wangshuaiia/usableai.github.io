AI techniques like deep learning are increasingly being used to automate various tasks in the software engineering pipeline. We at the Volvo Group are currently investigating ways to use deep learning in order to assist automotive embedded software engineers with tasks like code review, design review, testing and quality assurance. To help us in this exciting enterprise we seek 4 interns who can work with us during full-time during summer 2023 (June-Aug).

### Work tasks would include:
- Assembling datasets from source code corpora and time-series repositories
- Use these datasets to pre-train and fine tune transformer-based models for necessary tasks
- Evaluate the performance of trained models

### Expected skill set
We're looking for people with these set of skills

#### Required
- Currently studying for a Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science, Computer science, or Software engineering. We are looking for students who are in the 1st year of master studies
- Fluency in writing Python code and shell scripting
- An inquisitive mind!

#### Desirable
- Familiarity with machine learning and/or deep learning frameworks like PyTorch
- Familiarity with transformers and convolutional neural networks
- Familiarity with Natural Language Processing
